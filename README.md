C++ Games and Utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These C++ programs were made in Borland International, Inc's Turbo C++ compiler version 3.0 on a Windows XP (32 bit) machine at time around 2003~2009

As on 2017, the 32 bit operating systems are obsolete and don't run the 32 bit EXE files compiled on above compilers. So to run these programs on 64 bit machines, following are the suggestions :-

(1) Install the DOSBox application to emulate 32 bit environment.
    * Visit http://www.dosbox.com
    * The compiler is already included in zip file turboc.zip

(2) Compile the included source codes in a modern compiler like Dev-C++ and change the source codes suitably for any compiler compatibility issues.

List of Programs:-

(1) Anaconda : Snake game in C++. 

(2) Tic Tac Toe : Tic Tac Toe game in C++; computer versus player. 

(3) Numbox : Bring the digits 1 ~ 8 in correct sequence by swapping a blank space in this C++ game.

(4) Cows and Bulls : A game in C++ to test your intelligence.

(5) Shuffle : A game in C++ to test your reaction times.

(6) Determinant Solver: Solve determinant of up to order of 80 if data range permits.

(7) Linear equations solver:Can potentially solve 80 linear equations if data range permits.

(8) Simplex : Simplex Tables generator tool for optimization (Excel and C++).

(9) Interpolation : Newton's Interpolation application in C++.

(10) Curvefitting : Least square polynomial fitting application in C++.

(11) Polynomial : Polynomial operations e.g. division, changing to factorial form etc. in C++.

(12) Permut : Generate all permutations of inputted characters in C++.

(13) Calculator : A simple calculator in C++ which can solve expressions containing brackets and show step by step calculation.

(14) Chaos to Order : A simulation of mutating polygon's - From Chaos to Order

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although all known care has been taken to ensure that there are no bugs in the programs, 
however it is understood that these are not professionally made and tested. These are shared "as is" 
and it is upto user's discretion and judgment to use these for any purpose.
